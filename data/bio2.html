<p align="JUSTIFY">1. <b>Octavia V. Rogers Albert </b>(1853-c.1890) 
          was born Octavia Victoria Rogers in Oglethorpe, Georgia, where she lived 
          in slavery until the Emancipation. Like millions of freed men, women, 
          and children, she had a deep yearning for learning, and eventually, 
          at Atlanta University, she studied to be a teacher .</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	This steady young woman was as serious about being 
          a stalwart Christian as she was about being a sterling teacher. While 
          still living in Oglethorpe, she had joined the African Methodist Episcopal 
          Church, which was led by the legendary Bishop Henry McNeal Turner. Not 
          unlike many of her contemporaries, Octavia Victoria Rogers saw teaching 
          as a form of worship and Christian service. Her first teaching job was 
          in Montezuma, Georgia. There, in 1874, when she was about twenty-one 
          years old, she married another teacher at this school: A.E.P. Albert, 
          who later became an ordained minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, 
          which Octavia was later to join. Soon after their marriage, the Alberts 
          moved to Houma, Louisiana, where Octavia began conducting interviews 
          with men and women once enslaved. These interviews were the raw material 
          for what became her intelligent collection of narratives, <b><i>The 
          House of Bondage, or Charlotte Brooks and Others Slaves</i></b>. "Never 
          forget" could have been this work's second subtitle. As scholar Frances 
          Smith Foster has observed, "the hymn that concludes Albert's volume 
          summarizes her theme that abolition was the triumph of God's will over 
          evil and that those who have been delivered must return to tell the 
          story."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Octavia Victoria Rogers Albert did not live to 
          see <i>The House of Bondage</i> reach the public. It was shortly after 
          her death that the New Orleans-based Methodist Episcopal Church newspaper 
          the <i>South-western Christian Advocate</i> serialized the work from 
          January to December 1890. In 1891, owing to the efforts of the author's 
          husband and their only child, Laura T. F. Albert, <i>The House of Bondage</i> 
          was published in book form.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2. <b>Anonymous </b>(1766-?), who 
          was born in Maryland and lived in bondage until about age thirty, brought 
          her memoir to a close with these words: "When I went forth, it was without 
          purse or scrip, and I have come through great tribulation and temptation 
          not by any might of my own, for I feel that I am but as dust and ashes 
          before my almighty Helper, who has, according to His promise, been with 
          me and sustained me through all, and gives me now firm faith that he 
          will be with me to the end, and, in his own good time, receive me into 
          His everlasting rest." </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	We do not know precisely when this saintly soul 
          passed away. All we know is that at the age of ninety-seven, this unordained 
          and frequently 'buked and scorned itinerant preacher, dictated her tender 
          story to someone who thought her dear. This brief narrative, <b><i>Memoir 
          of Old Elizabeth, A Coloured Woman</i></b>, was published in 1863 in 
          Philadelphia, where "Old Elizabeth" had been living since she was eighty-seven 
          years old.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3. <b>Eloise Bibb </b>(1878-1928?), 
          the daughter of Catherine Adele and Charles H. Bibb, had prosperous 
          beginnings because of her father's job as customs inspector in New Orleans, 
          Louisiana, where Eloise Albert Veronica Bibb was born. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Eloise Bibb was seventeen when she made her literary 
          debut with <b><i>Poems</i></b> (1895), published by Monthly Review Press 
          in Boston. This delicate collection includes "To the Sweet Bard of the 
          Women's Club," a tribute to another native of New Orleans, <b>Alice 
          Dunbar-Nelson</b>, whose <b><i>Violets and Other Tales</i></b> was published 
          by the same publisher and in the same year as Bibb's <i>Poems. </i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Eloise Bibb never expected to live off her writing, 
          but plotted a course to be a teacher. After attending Oberlin College's 
          Preparatory Academy (1899-1901), she taught in the New Orleans public 
          school system. In 1903, she left home again: this time for Washington, 
          D.C., where she enrolled in Howard University's Teacher's College. Bibb 
          graduated from Howard in the winter of 1908, and a few months later 
          became head resident of the university's Colored Social Settlement House.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Bibb left this job in 1911. This was the year 
          she married Noah Davis Thompson, a widower and father of a young son. 
          (Thompson's first wife was Lillian B. Murphy, daughter of the founder 
          of the <i>Baltimore Afro-American</i> and sister of Carl Murphy, who 
          turned the <i>Afro</i> into one of the finest new era newspapers.) Soon 
          after their marriage, the Thompsons moved to Los Angeles. There, in 
          and around various enterprises (including real estate), Noah contributed 
          articles to various periodicals as did Eloise, with <i>Los Angeles Tribune</i>, 
          <i>Out West</i>, and <i>Morning Sun</i> among her outlets. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1927, when Noah was hired as business manager 
          of the National Urban League's journal <i>Opportunity</i>, the Thompsons 
          moved to New York City, which is where Eloise Bibb Thompson died.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4. <b>Virginia W. Broughton </b>(?-?) 
          was one of several children born to a couple once enslaved in Virginia, 
          after which she was named. Virginia's parents had attained their freedom 
          through purchase: her father had worked diligently doing the work of 
          three men, saving every dime he could to buy himself and his wife out 
          of slavery. Their daughter inherited this can-do spirit, and became 
          equally successful. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Virginia Broughton received her early education 
          at a private school in her home state. When time came for more schooling, 
          she journeyed to Nashville, Tennessee, where she was among the first 
          students at the preparatory school at Fisk College, remaining there 
          to continue her undergraduate studies. When she graduated in 1875, she 
          was qualified to be a schoolteacher, a position which suited her talents. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	The school room was not the only place Broughton 
          made a positive impact. This devout Baptist was also a missionary. Her 
          primary area of ministry was to women, and she emerged as a leading 
          advocate of women's rights. Whereas some saw gender equality as somewhat 
          unorthodox and in conflict with the Scripture, Broughton found total 
          support for it in the Bible. Among the ways she disseminated her ideas 
          was with her 1904 book, <i>Women's Work, as Gleaned from the Women of 
          the Bible</i>. This book was a handy synthesis of what she shared in 
          her lectures and Bible studies and what she hoped would be shared in 
          the Bible bands she seeded throughout Tennessee. Those inspired and 
          uplifted by the life and works of Virginia Broughton very much appreciated 
          her autobiography, <b><i>Twenty Years' Experience of a Missionary</i></b> 
          (1907). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">5. <b>Hallie Q. Brown </b>(c. 1845-1949) 
          made the most of her roughly one hundred years on earth, lifting as 
          she climbed. This dynamo was born, along with her five siblings, in 
          Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to former slaves Frances Jane Scroggins and 
          Thomas Brown. Hallie's father was reportedly the first black express 
          agent in the nation and had been a worker on the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1864, the Brown family moved to Chatham, in 
          Ontario, Canada. A few years later, they returned to the United States, 
          settling in Wilberforce, Ohio, where Hallie enrolled in Wilberforce 
          University, which was then under the leadership of a Brown family friend: 
          renowned A.M.E. bishop Daniel Alexander Payne who was to become one 
          of Hallie's major mentors.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	After graduating from Wilberforce in 1873, Hallie 
          Quinn Brown embarked on what was to be an illustrious career in education. 
          For about a dozen years, she taught at several schools in the South. 
          From 1885 to 1887 she served as dean of Allen University in Columbia, 
          South Carolina. From 1887 to 1892 she taught in the public schools of 
          Dayton, Ohio, where she opened a night school for migrants from the 
          South. During her days in Dayton, Brown assiduously studied oratory, 
          and launched into another career: public speaking.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	From 1892 to 1893, Brown served as Lady Principal 
          at Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. She spent the majority of 
          her career - some three decades - as professor of elocution at Wilberforce 
          University. Besides teaching, she lectured and produced the handbooks 
          <i>Bits and Odds: A Choice Selection of Recitations</i> (1900) and <i>First 
          Lessons in Public Speaking</i> (1920). She played major roles in 
          various civic organizations, including the Women's Christian Temperance 
          Union, the Ohio State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, where she 
          was president from 1905 to 1912; and the National Association of Colored 
          Women, which she co-founded and for which she served as president from 
          1920 to 1924. Brown was also involved in the Ohio Council of Republican 
          Women, the National League of Women Voters, and the Negro Women's National 
          Republican League.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Health problems compelled Brown to retire from 
          Wilberforce in 1923. She did not retire from all activity, however. 
          She continued to lecture, and she also continued to write. In 1925 her 
          <i>Tales My Father Told</i> was published. In 1926, when Brown was in 
          her late seventies or early eighties, her best known book came out: 
          <b><i>Homespun Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</i></b>, a collection 
          of sixty biographies (one-third written by Brown) of black women born 
          in the United States or Canada between the mid-1740s and 1900. As scholar 
          Randall K. Burkett observed, the sketches in <i>Homespun Heroines</i>  
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "offer indispensable starting points for biographical 
          research on a substantial number of extraordinary women." Included in 
          that number are several women in <i>The Schomburg</i> <i>Library of 
          Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers</i>. Among them are <b>Frances 
          E.W. Harper</b>, <b>Elizabeth Keckley</b>, <b>C. Henrietta Ray, Amanda 
          Smith</b>, and <b>Phillis Wheatley</b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">6. <b>Josephine Brown </b>(1839-?), 
          the youngest child of the abolitionist and author William Wells Brown 
          and his wife Elizabeth, was born in Buffalo, New York, five years after 
          her father made his famous escape from slavery. In 1845, the Browns 
          moved to Farmington, New York. When William and Elizabeth separated 
          two years later, it was William who got custody of Josephine and her 
          sister Clarissa; however, the girls never lived with him continuously. 
          With Boston as his new home base and his daughters in the care of some 
          friends (and attending a school in New Bedford), William Wells Brown 
          was on the road with antislavery work. Then, in 1849, he moved to London.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	At some point in 1852, after attending a seminary 
          in Calais, France, for about a year, Josephine and Clarissa Brown arrived 
          in London, where they continued their education. After about a year 
          and a half, both girls were qualified to teach. Josephine, not quite 
          fifteen, found a position at a school in Woolwich, where several of 
          her pupils were older than she was. During these days, Josephine also 
          kept quite busy as an assistant to her father's extensive antislavery 
          activities. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1854, Josephine was again in France for additional 
          schooling. At some point in 1855, she returned to the United States, 
          where she completed the biography of her father she had begun in France: 
          <b><i>Biography of an AmericanBondman, by His Daughter</i></b>. As Josephine 
          Brown explained in her preface to the book, she was moved to finish 
          the book when she discovered that her father's autobiography <i>Narrative 
          of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave</i> (1847) was out of print. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	During the first few weeks of the release of <i>Biography 
          of An American Bondman</i>, father and daughter were quite busy with 
          speaking engagements, and a time or two Josephine, nearing seventeen, 
          lectured independently. In the winter of 1856, Josephine Brown sailed 
          for England. Virtually nothing is known of her life after that point.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">7. <b>Annie L. Burton </b>(c.1850-c. 
          1910), who spent her childhood enslaved in Alabama, was the daughter 
          of a woman named Nancy, the cook of Mr. and Mrs. William Farrin whose 
          plantation was near Clayton. Annie Louise's father, a white man born 
          in Liverpool, England, owned a plantation that was a long walk from 
          the Farrins. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Annie Louise was a teenager when Union troops liberated 
          her, her mother and siblings, and others in the area; and she remained 
          in the South during the Civil War and for a good many years after it. 
          She left the South in 1879, living in Boston and then in New York City. 
          In both cities, she supported herself as a domestic worker (cook, maid, 
          housekeeper, laundress). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In the early 1880s, Annie Louise returned South 
          because her sister died, leaving behind a son who would have become 
          an orphan were it not for his aunt Annie. Aunt Annie boasted that she 
          was able to support her nephew all the way through his studies at Hampton 
          Institute in Virginia. She was able to do this largely because of her 
          success as a restaurateur, first in Jacksonville, Florida, and later 
          in Boston. It was in Boston that this small-business owner married Samuel 
          Burton. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Always intent on bettering herself, in 1900 Annie 
          Louise Burton started attending a night school in Boston. She took classes 
          at this school for about six years, and at the same time, she began 
          work on the two autobiographical essays in her book <b><i>Memories of 
          Childhood's Slavery</i> </b>(1909). The book also contains a composition 
          on Abraham Lincoln along with Burton's favorite poems and hymns.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">8. <b>Olivia Ward Bush </b>(1869-1944), 
          born in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York, was the daughter of Eliza 
          Draper and Abraham Ward, both of whom were of African and Montauk descent. 
          Olivia was not yet a year old when her mother died. Shortly thereafter, 
          her father moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he married again, 
          and handed Olivia over to her mother's sister, Maria Draper, who reared 
          Olivia as her own child. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1889, Olivia Ward married Frank Bush, and the 
          couple became parents to two children, Rosamund and Maria. The Bushes 
          divorced at some point between 1895 and 1910, whereupon Olivia and her 
          daughters went to live with Aunt Maria. By now, Olivia's interest in 
          the arts was quite apparent. In 1899 her slim volume of verse, <i>Original 
          Poems</i>, was published and received kudos from Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
          In 1914, a more substantial collection of prose and poetry was published: 
          <b><i>Driftwood</i></b>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Marriage to Anthony Banks in the early 1920s resulted 
          in a move to Chicago. There, Olivia continued her artistic endeavors, 
          focusing on drama, which she had dabbled in years before. For a time, 
          she worked as a drama instructor in the Chicago public school system 
          and ran the Bush-Banks School of Expression. In the 1930s, Olivia Ward 
          Bush Banks returned to the East, where she lived in New Rochelle and 
          in New York City. The woman who counted W.E.B. Du Bois, Countee Cullen, 
          and Paul Robeson among her friends, and who in various ways boosted 
          emerging lights (including Richmond Barthé and Langston Hughes) 
          exercised her creativity in a number of ways: she had an arts column 
          in the <i>Westchester Record-Courier</i>, she was a drama coach for 
          Abyssinian Baptist Church's Community Center; and she wrote several 
          plays, pageants, and short stories, most of which were never published.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">9. <b>Lucy A. Delaney </b>(c. 1830-c.1890s), 
          who was born in slavery in St. Louis, Missouri, was fiercely determined 
          to be free, just like her older sister Nancy who had escaped to Canada, 
          and their mother, Polly Berry, who had escaped and then secured her 
          freedom in court, on the grounds that she was a freeborn who had been 
          kidnapped as a child. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Lucy Ann was twelve years old when she escaped 
          to Chicago, Illinois, where her mother was living. Polly Berry promptly 
          set about suing for her daughter's freedom on the grounds that she was 
          the daughter of a freeborn and hence could not be enslaved. Although 
          mother and daughter were eventually victorious, their case was not dealt 
          with swiftly: Lucy Ann was forced to spend more than a year in jail 
          pending its resolution.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Once Lucy Ann Berry was freed at the age of fourteen, 
          she and her mother made a tolerable life in Chicago, plying their trades: 
          Lucy, a seamstress; Polly, a laundress. When, in 1845, Lucy married 
          Frederick Turner, Polly moved with the couple to Quincy, Illinois. Lucy's 
          marriage was short-lived: Frederick died in an explosion aboard the 
          steamer on which he worked. Soon after Frederick's death, mother and 
          daughter returned to St. Louis, where in 1849 Lucy married Zachariah 
          Delaney. This marriage lasted for more than four decades, and the couple 
          had four children, all of whom died young. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	During the remainder of her life, Lucy Ann Berry 
          Turner Delaney, who joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in the mid-1850s, 
          worked for the uplift of her people through various organizations, including 
          the Female Union and the Daughters of Zion. Her desire to inspire her 
          people to make the most of freedom was behind her decision to put into 
          print her dramatic life story, which was published around 1891: <b><i>From 
          Darkness Cometh the Light; or, Struggles for Freedom</i></b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">10. <b>Alice Dunbar-Nelson </b>(1875-1935) 
          was born Alice Ruth Moore, in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she attended 
          high school and then completed a teacher-training program at Straight 
          College (now Dillard University). Over the years she taught at various 
          institutions, but teaching was far from her only talent. She knew bookkeeping 
          and stenography which she used occasionally to support herself. She 
          was also an above average student of the piano and cello and could act. 
          Her finest gift and reigning passion, however, was writing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Alice Ruth Moore's debut as a serious writer came 
          in 1895 with the publication of <b><i>Violets and Other Tales</i> </b>, 
          a collection of poetry, short stories, essays, reviews and other prose 
          pieces. This little book brought Alice to the attention of the most 
          celebrated poet of the day Paul Laurence Dunbar. A friendship that began 
          with correspondence blossomed into a romance, and Alice and Paul married 
          in 1898, setting up house in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	This marriage boosted Alice's literary career. 
          Although she was a good writer, had she not been Mrs. Dunbar, Paul's 
          publisher (Dodd, Mead and Company) probably never would have simultaneously 
          published in 1899 Paul's <i>Poems of Cabin and Field </i>and Alice's 
          <b><i>The Goodness of St. Rocque and Other Stories</i></b>. Alice and 
          Paul seemed the ideal couple, but their marriage was fraught with troubles. 
          The Dunbars separated in 1901 (Paul died in 1906). Alice Ruth Moore 
          Dunbar married again: in 1910, to Henry Arthur Callis, a teacher at 
          the time; and in 1916, to journalist Robert J. Nelson, with whom she 
          published the Wilmington <i>Advocate</i>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Over the years this multi-talented woman continued 
          to write. She contributed poetry and prose to the <i>Journal of Negro

<p align="JUSTIFY">11. <b>Julia A. J. Foote </b>(1823-1900), 
          the daughter of former slaves, was born in Schenectady, New York. Her 
          parents were devout Christians, and she embraced their faith at an early 
          age, joining the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church when she was 
          fifteen years old, by which time she was living in Albany with her adopted 
          family.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Marriage in 1841 to a seafarer, George Foote, took 
          eighteen-year-old Julia to Boston, where she joined this city's African 
          Methodist Episcopal Zion church. Julia Foote's ever-increasing hunger 
          for knowledge of the Holy was applauded; however, her insistence that 
          God had called her to preach put a strain on her relationships with 
          those who believed it absolutely inappropriate and downright wrong for 
          a woman to be a preacher. Julia's parents did not support her call. 
          Her husband did not support her call. Her pastor, Reverend Jeheiel C. 
          Beman, not only did not think she should preach, but he also censured 
          her for engaging in ministry in her home. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Convinced that she had to answer to a higher power, 
          Foote persevered, finding pulpits, homes, revival camps and other venues 
          where her gifts of the Spirit were welcomed. Julia A. Foote preached 
          up a storm: early on in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, 
          and later, in Michigan, Ohio and Canada. Eventually, she settled in 
          Cleveland, Ohio, where in 1879, she published her autobiography: <b><i>A 
          Brand Plucked From the Fire</i></b>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	We do not know how or where this evangelist spent 
          the 1880s and early 1890s, but we know that in 1894 Julia A. Foote became 
          the A.M.E. Zion Church's first woman deacon. In 1900, shortly before 
          her death, she became this denomination's second ordained female elder.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">13. <b>Frances E. W. Harper </b>(1825-1911), 
          born free in Baltimore, Maryland, was not yet three years old when her 
          mother, the only parent she ever knew, died. Frances Ellen was raised 
          for a time by an aunt, and then sent to live with an uncle, Reverend 
          William Watkins, who ran a school in Baltimore. She stayed in Uncle 
          William's charge until she was about thirteen, at which point she was 
          sent out to earn a living.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Young Frances found work as a servant and babysitter, 
          and sewing for the Armstrongs, a white family in Baltimore. Much to 
          Frances's delight, Mr. Armstrong owned a bookstore. Better still, he 
          allowed her free access to books and encouraged her in her love for 
          writing. Around 1846, when she was in her early thirties, Frances became 
          active as an anti-slavery lecturer and published her first collection 
          of poetry, <i>Forest Leaves</i>, now extant. Writing remained a passion 
          and she became a most celebrated writer, "the Bronze Muse." In 1860, 
          she married Fenton Harper. The couple had a daughter but Fenton died 
          in 1864. Harper subsequently became the most widely published and recognized 
          writer before and after slavery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Frances Ellen Watkins Harper's body of work includes 
          several collections of poetry. Among them are the following, published 
          between 1872 and 1900: <i>Sketches of Southern Life</i>, <i>Moses: A 
          Story of the Nile</i>, <i>Light Beyond Darkness</i>, <i>The Sparrow's 
          Fall</i>, <i>Martyr of Alabama</i>, <i>Atlanta Offerings</i>, and <i>Poems</i>. 
          "The Slave Mother," "The Slave Auction," "The Fugitive's Wife," and 
          "Bury Me in a Free Land," are among her best known poems.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Harper was also a gifted writer of prose. One 
          of her best known essays is "Christianity" (1853). Her most famous short 
          story is "The Two Offers," which first appeared in the <i>Anglo-African</i> 
          in 1859. Known as the first African American woman novelist until recently, 
          Harper's first three novels were serialized in the African Methodist 
          Episcopal Church's <i>Christian Recorder</i>: <i>Minnie's Sacrifice</i> 
          (1869); <i>Sowing and Reaping: A Temperance Story</i> (1876-1877), and 
          <i>Trial and Triumph</i> (1888-1889). In 1892, Harper's best known novel 
          was published: <b><i>Iola Leroy: or, Shadows Uplifted</i></b>, the story 
          of a young woman striving to overcome racism during Civil War/Reconstruction 
          America, who commits herself to the cause of racial uplift.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Harper managed her writing life in and around 
          other important work. She was a teacher, an anti-slavery lecturer, a 
          member of the Free Produce and, according to William Still, one of the 
          "ablest" workers on the Underground Railroad. After the Civil War, Harper 
          continued a life of activism as a social reformer-especially promoting 
          civil and women's rights. She advanced these causes through her writing, 
          through countless speaking engagements, and through her work with several 
          organizations, including the American Equal Rights Association, the 
          Women's Christian Temperance Union, the YMCA, the National Congress 
          of Colored Women, and the National Association of Colored Women, of 
          which she was a founding member.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">14. <b>Josephine D. Heard</b> (1861-1921?) 
          was born Josephine Delphine Henderson in Salisbury, North Carolina, 
          several months after the outbreak of the Civil War. She was the daughter 
          of Lafayette and Annie M. Henderson who knew a modicum of "freedom" 
          during their days in slavery: they were allowed to hire themselves out 
          and live in Charlotte. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	When freedom came, the Hendersons committed themselves 
          to providing their daughter with educational opportunities. So it was 
          that their Josie, who was reading by age five, attended a school in 
          Charlotte, and then Scotia Seminary in nearby Concord and Bethany Institute 
          in New York, all of this, to prepare her for teaching. Her first post 
          was at a school in tiny Mayesville, South Carolina, where the epic Mary 
          McLeod Bethune was born in 1875. In 1882, twenty-one-year-old Josephine 
          Henderson married the Georgia-born William Henry Heard (1850-1937). 
          Heard had emerged from slavery to be a teacher, a worker for the Republican 
          party, a railway postal clerk, and then a minister in the African Methodist 
          Episcopal Church. William Henry Heard entered the ministry in 1882, 
          the same year he and Josie married. The couple subsequently relocated 
          to Philadelphia, where in 1890, Josephine published <b><i>Morning Glories</i></b>, 
          a collection of seventy-two poems, about love and death, about religion 
          and race, and other subjects, verse that sprang, as she wrote in her 
          preface, "from a heart that desires to encourage and inspire the youth 
          of the Race." This book, expanded and re-released in 1891, carried an 
          introduction from the eminent A.M.E. bishop Benjamin Tucker Tanner, 
          father of one the first black female physician's Hallie Tanner Dillon 
          and the acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Josephine Heard moved frequently in the remaining 
          years of her life, assisting her husband's work. In 1895 President Grover 
          Cleveland appointed William Heard minister resident and consul general 
          to Liberia, where Heard helped start the first A.M.E. Church in Monrovia. 
          In 1908, the year William was made a bishop and sent to West Africa 
          again, Josephine accompanied him. The couple lived there until the onset 
          of World War I. After that, William's job assignments took the couple 
          to Louisiana, Mississippi, and finally, to Philadelphia, where Josephine 
          died. In his autobiography, <i>From Slavery to the Bishopric in the 
          A.M.E. Church</i>, published in the early 1920s, William Henry Heard 
          paid tribute to his wife: "She is scholarly and poetic, and her use 
          of the English language, as well as the criticism of my sermons, have 
          done much in making me the preacher they say I am."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">15. <b>Pauline E. Hopkins </b>(1859-1930), 
          the daughter of Sarah A. Allen and Northrup Hopkins, was born in Portland 
          Maine, and raised in Boston. This child of promise, whose family tree 
          included Boston's famous Paul family (Reverends Nathaniel, Thomas, and 
          activist Susan) and poet James Whitfield, committed herself a life of 
          writing when she was young. At age fifteen, Pauline won a ten dollar 
          gold prize for her essay "Evils of Intemperance and Their Remedies" 
          in a contest sponsored by William Wells Brown, father of <b>Josephine 
          Brown</b>. After graduating from Boston's Girls High School, Pauline 
          was even more intent on making it as writer. Her early efforts include 
          a musical drama <i>Slaves' Escape; or the Underground Railroad</i>, 
          which drew applause during its brief run in Boston in 1880. Aware of 
          what a precarious passage a writing life could be, Hopkins made sure 
          she had a skill that would allow her to support herself: stenography. 
          Indeed, it was as a stenographer, for individuals and for the government, 
          that she supported herself from 1892 to 1899. Nevertheless, throughout 
          this period she continued to write. In 1900 her novel, <i>Contending 
          Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life in the North and South</i>, 
          was published by the Colored Co-Operative Publishing Company. This firm 
          owned the <i>Colored American</i> magazine, which hired Hopkins as literary 
          editor following the publication of <i>Contending Forces</i>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	A fair amount of Hopkins's prose appeared in the 
          pages of <i>Colored American</i>: more than twenty biographies of eminent 
          black Americans; over half a dozen short stories; and three novels, 
          <i>Hagar's Daughter: A Story of Southern Caste Prejudice</i>, <i>Winona: 
          A Tale of Negro Life in the South and Southwest</i>; and <i>Of One Blood; 
          or, The Hidden Self</i> Ball serialized between 1901 and 1903, and written 
          under the pseudonym Sarah Allen. In 1904, Hopkins left the <i>Colored 
          American</i>, after a Booker T. Washington proxy took over the magazine. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Hopkins went on to write for a few other publications, 
          including J. Max Barber's militant <i>Voice of the Negro. </i> She also 
          started a publishing company, P.E. Hopkins, which in 1905 put out her 
          booklet <i>A Primer of Facts Pertaining to the Early Greatness of the 
          African Race and the Possibility of Restoration by Its Descendants, 
          With Epilogue</i>. In 1916, Hopkins became editor of the short-lived 
          <i>New Era</i> magazine. After the magazine folded Hopkins withdrew 
          from a literary life, eventually dying in obscurity. It was not until 
          scholar Ann Allen Shockley rediscovered her work and shared the first 
          fruits of her research in the article "Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins: A 
          Biographical Excursion into Obscurity," (<i>Phylon</i> 1972) that Pauline 
          E. Hopkins began to receive the attention she deserves.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">16. <b>Harriet A. Jacobs</b> (1813-1897), 
          born in slavery in Edenton, North Carolina, and until she was around 
          eleven years old, was owned by Margaret Horniblow, who taught her to 
          read and sew. When Horniblow died, Harriet and her brother came under 
          the control of Mrs. Horniblow's brother, Dr. James Norcom, who proved 
          to be a lecherous fiend.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Subsequent events in the life of Harriet Jacobs 
          include her decision to have two children with a single white man who 
          was not her owner; escape from Dr. Norcom in 1835; and, after nearly 
          seven years of hiding out in a crawlspace in her grandmother's house, 
          escape to New York City, where she was a domestic worker for the family 
          of Nathaniel Parker Willis. All of this is fleshed out in Jacobs's autobiographical 
          narrative <b><i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i></b> (1861), 
          in which Jacobs's did not use peoples' real names and claimed the pseudonym 
          Linda Brent for herself.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	For most of the twentieth century, Linda Brent 
          was thought to be a white woman, and <i>Incidents in the Life of A Slave 
          Girl</i>, a work of pure fiction. It was not until the 1980s that Harriet 
          A. Jacobs's authorship was reestablished. Today, it is regarded as the 
          most in-depth and textured pre-Civil War slave narrative written by 
          a black woman in America.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	The rediscovery of Jacobs led to the uncovering 
          of events in her life after 1861. These include serving as a relief 
          worker during the Civil War, working as a clerk for the New England 
          Women's Club, operating a boardinghouse that catered to students and 
          faculty at Harvard University, and doing social work among the needy

          moved to Baltimore. There, in 1877, she married an activist, author, 
          and pastor of Union Baptist Church, Reverend Dr. Harvey Johnson. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Amelia Johnson became a minister of sorts herself. 
          Her medium was writing. With a deep burden for the young and Proverbs 
          22:6 undoubtedly in the forefront of her mind ("Train up a child in 
          the way that he should go. . .") Johnson produced literature for children. 
          In 1888, a year after she launched the small monthly newspaper <i>Joy</i>, 
          she started <i>Ivy</i>, a publication for children that had black history 
          as its focus. Johnson also contributed poems and short stories for children 
          to <i>National Baptist</i>, <i>American Baptist</i>, and <i>Sower and 
          Reaper</i> among other periodicals. She wrote three little novels as 
          well. All three are about following the correct moral path, and feature 
          protagonists who are whiteBor, as some scholars prefer "racially indeterminate." 
          Published by the American Baptist Publication Society these novels are: 
          <i>Clarence and Corrine; or, God's Way</i> (1890); <b><i>The Hazeley

          (c.1824-1907), born in Dinwiddie Court-House, Virginia, was the product 
          of a foul union between an enslaved woman and her owner. Little Elizabeth 
          knew a succession of owners and abuses during her young life. Her last 
          place of enslavement was in St. Louis, Missouri, where in the early 
          1850s, her owner (the daughter of her original owner) hired her out 
          as seamstress.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Elizabeth became a top-notch seamstress and a much 
          sought-after dressmaker. Though she had to give some of her wages to 
          her owner, she managed to put some money away for her high hope: freedom, 
          not just for herself but also for her son born of a rape. With loans 
          from some of her customers and her savings, Elizabeth came up with the 
          $1,200 she needed to purchase freedom for herself and her son. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Following two terrible marriages (to a Mr. Hobbs 
          and a Mr. James Keckley) and a short residence in Baltimore, Maryland, 
          Elizabeth settled in Washington, D.C. There, she opened a dressmaking 
          shop, which employed some twenty people at one point. As word of her 
          talent spread, Elizabeth Keckley attracted more and more customers from 
          Washington society, this at a time when talk of a civil war was very 
          much in the air. One of Keckley's customer's was Varina Howell Davis, 
          whose husband, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis, was to become President 
          of the Confederacy. Another was Mrs. McClean, the daughter of General 
          Sumner. It was she who brought Keckley to the attention of Mary Todd

          Keckley recounted all this and more in <b><i>Behind the Scenes, Or, 
          Thirty Years a Slave and Four Years in the White House</i></b> (1868), 
          a book which made Keckley quite a sensation; however, it wasn't the 
          kind of attention she had hoped for. The backlash was severe. She lost 
          friends and her once-thriving business. Keckley did not spend the rest 
          of her life in Washington, D.C., but it was where she died, having spent

          later. Though filled with fear and trembling over something so rare, 
          a woman preacher, she obeyed the Holy Spirit and set about heeding the 
          call in decency and order. This meant getting the blessing of the senior 
          minister of her church, Richard Allen, co-founder of the African Methodist 
          Episcopal Church and pastor of its first church, Philadelphia's Mother 
          Bethel. Reverend Allen did not sanction Lee's call, claiming that the

<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	The name on her death certificate was "Menken 
            Adele Isaac Barclay" and her tombstone read, "Adah Isaacs Menken." 
            She was, perhaps, born Philomène Croi Théodore but assumed 
            half a dozen pseudonyms over the years, identified five different 
            men as her father, and claimed to have had six husbands in sixteen 
            years. It is no wonder that since her death in 1868, "La Belle Menken" 
            has been examined in ten full-length biographies (plus dozens of articles 
            and parts of books); and even her latest and most reliable biographer 
            [Wolf Mankowtiz] admits, "I haven't found out who she was." </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</dir>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Menken, who never regarded herself as black and 
          at one point fabled herself Jewish, gained fame as a singer, dancer 
          and actress prone to the risque (a sort of proto-La Baker). This dazzling, 
          brash and beguiling star of stage traveled lushly, and had a host of 
          famous friends (among them, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain and Georges Sand) 
          and famous lovers (among them, Swinburne and Alexander Dumas <i>pere</i>). 
          	</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In and around her performances, her stormy private 
          life, and her lively social life, "The Naked Lady," as she was also 
          called, wrote poems. A selection of Menken's verse was published in 
          1868, shortly after her death at around the age of twenty-nine. The 
          small volume (dedicated to Charles Dickens) is entitled <b><i>Infelicia</i></b>. 
          In her analysis of this poetry Joan R. Sherman summed it up as "remarkably 
          dramatic, intensely self-aware and confessional," and unsparing in its 
          condemnation of a male-dominated world that restricts woman's freedom, 
          mocks her expressions of &gt;genius,' and dooms her, body and soul, 
          to unhappiness." </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">24. <b>Mrs. N. F. Mossell</b> (1855-1948) 
          was Gertrude Bustill Mossell. This native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
          was a great-granddaughter of Cyrus Bustill who served George Washington's 
          troops as a baker and after the War of Independence, started what became 
          a successful bakery in Philadelphia. The elder Bustill also co-founded 
          the first black mutual aid society in America, the Free African Society. 
          Among the many other Bustills of distinction are Gertrude's great-aunt, 
          abolitionist and educator Grace Bustill Douglass and her daughter Sarah 
          Mapp Douglass, who followed in her mother's footsteps. Gertrude's most 
          famous descendant was her nephew Paul Bustill Robeson.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Gertrude Bustill was a typical Bustill, a striver, 
          a doer, an achiever. After graduating from Robert Vaux Grammar School, 
          she taught school for several years in Philadelphia and elsewhere. However, 
          it was as a journalist that Gertrude Bustill really distinguished herself, 
          this at a time when women journalists were extremely rare.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Gertrude Bustill's potential as writer-thinker 
          was evident when she was young. There was, for example, "Influence," 
          the speech she delivered at her high-school commencement. This speech 
          was deemed so fine by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner that he published it 
          in his <i>Christian Recorder</i>. Years later, Bustill's articles on 
          political and social issues, with a heavy emphasis on women's rights 
          and responsibilities, were being read in a number of periodicals, including 
          the <i>AME Church Review</i>, the <i>Philadelphia Times</i>, the <i>Philadelphia 
          Echo</i>, and the <i>Independent</i>. For a time, she edited the Woman's 
          Department of the <i>New York Freeman</i>, the <i>Indianapolis World</i>, 
          and the <i>New York Age</i>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	There came a day when Gertrude Bustill was juggling 
          a career and a family life: in 1893 she married a leading Philadelphia 
          physician, Nathan Frances Mossell, with whom she was to have two daughters. 
          Around the time of her wedding, Mossell was no doubt at work on what 
          was to be an important little book: <b><i>The Work of the Afro-American 
          Woman </i></b>(1894) ,a collection of essays and poems bearing witness 
          to the achievements of black women in a range of fields. As scholar 
          Joanne Braxton has pointed out, this book was for the black woman of 
          the 1890s what Paula Giddings's <i>When and Where I Enter</i> was for 
          the black woman of the 1980s. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Why did Gertrude Bustill Mossell, with such strong 
          feminist leanings, publish her book under her husband's initials? Braxton 
          offers the following explanation: "By this strategy of public modesty, 
          the author signaled her intention to defend and celebrate black womanhood 
          without disrupting the delicate balance of black male-female relations 
          or challenging masculine authority." </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	The year after <i>The Work of the Afro-American 
          Woman </i> came out, Gertrude Bustill Mossell was busy helping her husband 
          with the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and Training School, which 
          opened in 1895: she headed up the fundraising drive, raising $30,000, 
          and went on to serve as president of its Social Service Auxiliary. Her 
          other civic activities included organizing the Philadelphia branch of 
          the National Afro-American Council. The only other book Gertrude Bustill 
          Mossell wrote was a children's book, <i>Little Dansie's One Day at Sabbath 
          School</i> (1902).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">25. <b>Ann Plato </b>(1820?-?), 
          who picked up the pen to exhort others to live a holy life, was apparently 
          someone who practiced what she preached. Plato's piety and sterling 
          character were much in evidence according to abolitionist, author, and 
          minister James W.C. Pennington, pastor of the Colored Congregational 
          Church of Hartford, Connecticut, where Ann Plato worshiped. Reverend 
          Pennington's words of commendation are found in the introduction he 
          contributed to Plato's <b><i>Essays; Including Biographies and Miscellaneous 
          Pieces, in Prose and Poetry</i></b> (1841), the second book by a black 
          woman to be published in America.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">26. <b>Mary Prince</b> (c.1788-?), 
          who was born in slavery in Bermuda, endured an extremely savage enslavement 
          on that island and in Antigua. After she secured her freedom in England 
          in 1828, Prince was adamant about recounting the miseries inflicted 
          upon her mind, body and soul as a way to convert others to the antislavery 
          movement. She dictated the story of her life in bondage and her early 
          days of freedom to a Mrs. S. and the material was edited slightly by 
          Mr. Pringle for whom Mary Prince worked as a domestic, for the making 
          of the small yet vigorous <b><i>The History of Mary Prince, A West Indian 
          Slave</i></b> (1831), the first known autobiography by a black woman 
          enslaved in the Americas.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">27. <b>Nancy Prince </b>(1799-?), 
          who was born Nancy Gardner (or Gardener) in Newburysport, Massachusetts, 
          had an extremely difficult childhood: it was marked and twisted by poverty, 
          and by what we today call a dysfunctional family. Despite her bleak 
          beginnings, young Nancy remained hopeful and spirited, enabling her 
          to rise above the pain, and to help others as well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In February 1824, this twenty-three-year-old berry-picker 
          turned domestic, married a sea captain, known today only by his surname, 
          Prince. Nancy's husband, a native of Massachusetts, had lived for a 
          time in Russia, where he served in the royal court. In the summer of 
          1824, he returned to Russia and his wife went with him.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	While her husband served in the court of Czar 
          Alexander I, Nancy Prince made the most of her days in St. Petersburg 
          by starting a business: children's clothing and linens and things for 
          infants. She also started an orphanage. Unprepared for the difficult 
          Russian winters, Nancy's health began to decline and in 1833 she returned 
          to America. Her husband was to follow after the conclusion of his duty, 
          but sadly, Mr. Prince died in Russia. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Meanwhile, Nancy had settled in Boston, where 
          she became involved with abolitionist efforts. With a strong interest 
          in homeless children, she also established an orphanage here, and struggled 
          in vain to maintain it. An encounter with a minister from Jamaica where 
          slavery had been abolished in 1833 prompted Nancy Prince to journey 
          to that island in 1840. As she later recalled, "I hoped that I might 
          aid, in some small degree, to raise up and encourage the emancipated 
          inhabitants, and teach the young children to read and work, to fear 
          God, and put their trust in the Saviour." </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	To establish a school for destitute children in 
          Jamaica, Nancy Prince went on fundraising missions in the United States. 
          She also self-published the pamphlet <i>The West Indies: Being a Description 
          of the Islands, Progress of Christianity, Education, and Liberty Among 
          the Colored Population Generally</i>. All of Prince's hard work for 
          what became the Free Labor School in Kingston, Jamaica, was sabotaged 
          by corrupt co-workers. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1843, Prince, whose health continued its steady 
          decline, returned to Boston for good. She fell on hard times, and at 
          one point lived on the kindness of friends. Not wanting to be a total 
          charity case, she decided to write her memoirs, hoping she would be 
          able to support herself at least in part from the sales. This book, 
          <b><i>A Narrative of the Life of and Travels of Mrs. Nancy Prince</i></b>, 
          which contained her 1841 pamphlet, came out in 1850. A second edition 
          was published in 1853, followed by a third in 1856. To date, nothing 
          is known of Nancy Prince's later life or the circumstances of her death.

<p align="JUSTIFY">28. <b>H. Cordelia Ray</b> (1852?-1916) 
          was "well-born, well bred and enjoyed all the advantages accruing to 
          her position in a family where birth, breeding and culture were regarded 
          as important assets," wrote <b>Hallie Q. Brown</b> in <b><i>Homespun 
          Heroines and Other Women of Distinction</i></b>. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Considered a cultivated, virtuous woman, Ray was 
          born in New York City, one of seven children of Charlotte Augusta Burrough 
          and Charles B. Ray, a blacksmith turned Congregational minister and 
          leading abolitionist. Henrietta Cordelia Ray was named after a dynamo: 
          her father's first wife, Henrietta Green Regulus Ray, co-founder of 
          the African Dorcas Association, a support group for the Free African 
          Schools, and first president of the New York Female Literary Society 
          (also known as the Colored Ladies Literary Society). Henrietta's aspirations 
          were noble: she grew up to be a teacher. After graduating from the University 
          of the City of New York (1891) and the Sauvener School of Languages, 
          she taught for many years in the New York City public school system. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Ray hoped to also make her mark in literature. 
          She gained some major notice as a writer in April 1876. The occasion 
          was the unveiling of the Freedmen's Monument in Washington, D.C. for 
          which Frederick Douglass delivered the keynote address and where William 
          E. Matthews read Ray's ode, "Lincoln." The second in a series of important 
          family events, the occasion followed the celebration of Henrietta's 
          older sister Charlotte's graduation from Howard University, making her 
          the first black woman to earn a law degree from that University in 1872.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Years later, H. Cordelia Ray received praise for 
          the biography of her father which she co-authored with her sister Florence: 
          <i>Sketch of the Life of Rev. Charles B. Ray</i>, published in 1887. 
          By then, Ray's poetry had appeared in several periodicals, which encouraged 
          her efforts to publish a complete collection. <i>Sonnets</i> was published 
          in 1893 and<i> <b>Poems,</b></i> which contains <i>Sonnets,</i> came 
          out in 1910. About Ray's poetry, Hallie Q. Brown wrote that it "may 
          be likened to the quaint, touching music a shell murmuring of the sea, 
          a faint yet clear note sounding all the pathos and beauty of undying 
          life."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">29. <b>Frank Rollin </b>(1847-1901), 
          was born Frances Anne Rollin; "Frank" was her nickname. She was the 
          oldest of the five famous Rollin sisters: daughters of Margaretta and 
          William Rollin, a successful lumber merchant. The Rollin sisters grew 
          up in a mansion in Charleston, South Carolina, where all received excellent 
          educations and had a presence in the social and political life of black 
          Charleston. But it was in Boston that Frank made history. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Frances Rollin was living in Boston in 1868 where 
          she associated with historian William Cooper Nell, activist Lewis Hayden, 
          educator and diarist Charlotte Forten, and Richard T. Greener, first 
          black graduate of Harvard College. Rollin's social life included attending 
          readings by Ralph Waldo Emerson and other famous figures. She also was 
          an avid reader and writer. In her diary - one of the oldest by a southern 
          black woman, she noted the books she read which included: <b><i>Behind 
          the Scenes; or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House</i></b> 
          by <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Keckley</b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	The thing that most occupied Rollin's time during 
          her days in Boston was her research on South Carolina. She worked tirelessly 
          on an authorized biography of the physician, abolitionist, emigrationist, 
          military officer, and politician Martin Delany, who had been of help 
          to her in a successful discrimination suit she filed against a South 
          Carolina steamer. Initially, Delany was going to subsidize the book, 
          but when he hit upon financial troubles, he was unable to send Rollin 
          the expected monies. Supporting herself with bits and pieces of work 
          (including sewing), Rollin pressed on with the project, and was successful 
          in securing a publisher. This book, <b><i>The Life and Services of Martin 
          R. Delany</i></b>, was published in 1868, was the first biography of 
          a freeborn African-American man. Because Frances used her nickname Frank, 
          for a time people thought the author was a man.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Shortly after <i>The Life and Services of Martin 
          R. Delany</i> came out, Rollin returned to Columbia, South Carolina, 
          where her family had moved after the Civil War. There, she took a job 
          as a clerk in the law office of Union Army veteran and politician William 
          James Whipper, nephew of the Philadelphia activist William Whipper. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Frances and William married soon after she started 
          working for him and the couple had five children, only three of whom 
          lived into adulthood: Leigh Whipper, who became an actor of note; Winifred 
          who became a teacher in Washington, D.C.; and Ionia who graduated from 
          Howard Medical School in 1903, and in 1931 founded the Whipper Home

<p align="JUSTIFY">30. <b>Amanda Smith</b> (1837-1915) 
          Abecame known as one of the most remarkable preachers of any race or 
          any age." These words are from a sketch of the woman born Amanda Berry 
          by <b>Hallie Q. Brown</b> in her book <b><i>Homespun Heroines and Other 
          Women of Distinction </i></b>(1926). 	This woman whom Brown so admired 
          was born in slavery in Long Green, Maryland. Her liberator was her father, 
          Samuel Berry: after having purchased himself, he purchased this wife, 
          Mariam, and their five children. Eventually, the Berry family expanded 
          to include eight more children, and moved to a farm in York County, 
          Pennsylvania, where their home became an Underground Railroad station. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In 1854, at the age of seventeen, Amanda Berry 
          married Calvin Devine. The couple lived in New York City, where Amanda 
          worked as a domestic servant, and had two children, one of whom died 
          in infancy. Life with Calvin, a drunkard, was fraught with misery, but 
          Amanda was not crushed. This was largely due to the spiritual conversion 
          she experienced during the Great Awakening in 1856. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Not long after the outbreak of the Civil War, Calvin 
          Devine joined the Union Army, and was killed in battle in 1863. Amanda's 
          next husband was a coachman named James Smith. Philadelphia became Amanda's 
          new home, and she continued to earn a living at the only trade she knew: 
          domestic service. The African Methodist Episcopal Church became the 
          denomination she embraced, and she worshiped at Mother Bethel, the denomination's 
          cornerstone church where her husband was a deacon. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Amanda knew more sorrow during her second marriage. 
          The three children she had with James died very young. Moreover, James 
          Smith proved to be a disappointment as a husband and as a Christian. 
          Ironically, it was during her husband's falling away from the church 
          that Amanda was called to preach. After James' death, Amanda Smith's 
          decision to obey the call in 1869 initially met with much resistance 
          from the A.M.E. clergy. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	When she began, Amanda Smith preached primarily 
          in New York City and New Jersey, steadily amassing a strong following. 
          By 1870, evangelism was her only "job." By the end of the decade, she 
          was known as far north as Maine and as far south as Tennessee. By 1890, 
          Smith had brought souls to Christ and strengthened fellow believers 
          in England, India, Liberia and Sierra Leone, emerging as one of the 
          A.M.E. Church's most effective missionaries, and widening the way for 
          more black women to answer the call to preach. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1892, Smith settled near Chicago, Illinois, 
          in the temperance community of Harvey. There, she began writing her 
          life story, which was published in 1893: <b><i>An Autobiography: The 
          Story of the Lord's Dealings with Mrs. Amanda Smith, the Colored Evangelist</i></b>. 
          Smith was motivated, in large part, to produce her autobiography to 
          raise money for her new mission: the care of homeless black children. 
          With the proceeds from her book and donations from supporters, Smith 
          was able to open a small orphanage in Harvey in 1899: the Amanda Smith 
          Industrial Home.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	After so many years of toil, in 1912, when she 
          was in her mid-seventies, Amanda Berry Smith moved to Florida. She did 
          so at the urging of a wealthy white businessman, George Sebring, who 
          had long admired her work. This man provided Smith with a lovely home 
          and saw to it that she had no want or worries for the remainder of her 
          days. </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">31. <b>Effie Waller Smith</b> (1879-1960) 
          was the third of four children born to Frank Waller and Sibbie Ratliff, 
          both former slaves. Home was a farm in Chloe Creek, Kentucky, a few 
          miles away from Pikeville, and the Waller household was one in which 
          God was heavily praised and education highly prized.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	After completing the eighth grade at a local school, 
          like her older siblings Alfred and Rosa, Effie attended Kentucky Normal 
          School for Colored Persons in Frankfort, where between 1900 and 1902 
          she trained to be a teacher. Little is known about her teaching career 
          except that she taught school off and on for more than a dozen years, 
          sometimes in Kentucky and sometimes in Tennessee. Of Effie Waller's 
          writing life, we know a little bit more.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Several of Smith's poems had been published in 
          local papers by 1902 so that in 1904, her club of admirers and well-wishers 
          celebrated her first volume of verse, <b><i>Songs of the Months</i></b>, 
          released by a vanity press in New York City. The 110 poems in this collection 
          touched a range of subjects, including nature, romantic love, patriotism, 
          and not least of all, the months. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	The same year that <i>Songs of the Months</i> came 
          out, Effie Waller married a man named Lyss Cockrell who quit the marriage 
          when it was very young, and whom Effie divorced soon after he made his 
          exit. In 1908, she tried matrimony again with former classmate, Charles 
          Smith. This marriage, which produced one child who died in infancy, 
          was also brief, with Effie filing for divorce before the year was out.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	During all the personal trials of her life, Effie 
          Waller Smith kept at her writing, even getting three short stories published 
          in <i>Putnam's</i>. In 1909, two more volumes of her verse appeared. 
          The first was <b><i>Rhymes from the Cumberland</i></b>, which offers 
          meditations and remembrances of the Kentucky-Virginia Cumberland Mountains 
          area and musings on religion and romance. In the second volume, <i>Rosemary 
          and Pansies</i>, "many of the poems are somber and subdued yet definite 
          and conclusive as they examine issues and situations in life. There 
          is a mood maintained throughout that sometimes delves into the mystical." 
          These are the words of David Deskins, who has assiduously searched for 
          information and provided insights into the life and mind of this rather 
          unknown bard. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1917, when she was thirty-eight, Effie Waller 
          Smith appeared in print for the last time: the publication was the prestigious 
          magazine <i>Harper's</i>, and the work was a sonnet, "Autumn Winds." 
          After this, the Effie Waller Smith the writer apparently disappeared, 
          though the woman lived another forty years, the bulk of which she spent 
          in Wisconsin where she relocated in the mid-1920s and where she raised 
          Ruth, the daughter of a deceased friend whom she adopted in the late 
          1920s.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">32. <b>Maria W. Stewart (1803-1879)</b>, 
          neé Maria Miller, was born free in Hartford, Connecticut. Orphaned 
          by age five, she was the indentured servant of a cleric until the age 
          of fifteen. At the end of her indenture, she supported herself as a 
          domestic servant, and at some point moved to Boston. There, in 1826, 
          she married James W. Stewart, a veteran of the War of 1812, who was 
          an independent shipping agent. Maria and James were married by Reverend 
          Thomas Paul, founder of the African Baptist Church. Among the couple's 
          other notable acquaintances in Boston's black middle class, was the 
          activist David Walker; and it is believed that James Stewart played 
          a part in the smuggling into the South of Walker's famous <i>Appeal</i>, 
          which was published in 1829. This was the year that James W. Stewart 
          died. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	During her period of mourning, Maria Stewart had 
          to contend with white businessmen, allegedly executors of her husband's 
          estate, who swindled her out of her inheritance. In the wake of this 
          loss, Maria Stewart returned to the job market, and to the work she 
          knew best: domestic servant. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Maria Stewart's life broadened and intensified 
          following a religious experience which filled her with a desire to be, 
          as she put it, a "warrior" for her people. So it was that when in 1831, 
          William Lloyd Garrison issued a call for black women to contribute items 
          to his newspaper the <i>Liberator</i>, Stewart responded with the essay 
          "Religion and the Pure Principles of Morality, the Sure Foundation on 
          Which We Must Build." Other meditations from Stewart's pen flowed in 
          the pages of the <i>Liberator</i>, and soon her voice was heard not 
          only in print, but also from the podium.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Stewart's first public speaking engagement was 
          on April 28, 1832, before the African-American Female Intelligence Society 
          of America. A few months later, on September 21, 1832, at a New England 
          Anti-Slavery Society meeting in Boston's Franklin Hall, Stewart spoke 
          on the evils of slavery and the oppression of free blacks. With this 
          speech, Maria W. Stewart made history: the first woman to speak on political 
          issues before an audience composed of men and women and blacks and whites. 
          In subsequent addresses, Stewart spoke about not only race matters but 
          also about women's rights. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	Stewart's ideas and her eloquence have been preserved 
          in <i>Meditations from the Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart</i> (1832), 
          an enlarged edition of which Stewart self-published in 1879. In 1835 
          she published <b><i>Productions of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart</i></b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In the mid-1830s Maria W. Stewart left Boston and 
          began what was to be a long career as a schoolteacher, first in New 
          York City, then in Baltimore, Maryland, and finally, in Washington, 
          D.C., where her history-making friends and acquaintances included <b>Elizabeth 
          Keckley</b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">33. <b>Susie King Taylor</b> (1848-1912), 
          who was born in slavery, spent her early days in Savannah, Georgia, 
          with a grandmother, while her mother and siblings, also enslaved, lived 
          roughly thirty-five miles away on the Isle of Wight in Liberty County. 
        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Susie's grandmother saw to it that she received 
          some schooling, arranging for her to take lessons with a free woman. 
          Susie's grandmother also saw to it that the child got some "freedom 
          lessons," for Susie often went to secret "freedom meetings" with her 
          grandmother.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	When the Union troops raided Fort Pulaski in April 
          1862, fourteen-year-old Susie was among the dozens of blacks the Union 
          soldiers moved to Georgia's St. Simon's Island. There, a school was 
          set up at Gaston Bluff, and Susie was found sufficiently literate to 
          serve as its teacher. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	It was on St. Simon's Island that Susie met her 
          first husband. He was a former slave, named Edward King, who was a sergeant 
          in the first black regiment formed in the South, the First South Carolina 
          Volunteers, later known as the 33rd regiment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	When the Union forces evacuated St. Simon's, Susie 
          King followed the army to Camp Saxton in Beaufort, offering her services 
          as a laundress. Soon, she was assigned other duties. For a time she 
          did clerical work. When she showed herself a capable assistant to camp 
          doctors, she found herself serving as a nurse. In the course of her 
          nursing duties, she worked with Clara Barton, founder of the American 
          Red Cross.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	After the war, the Kings settled in Savannah, Georgia, 
          where Edward worked as a longshoreman and Susie opened a school in their 
          home. Soon, tragedy struck: Edward died from wounds suffered in a job-related 
          accident. Susie, pregnant at the time, returned to Liberty County. Twice 
          she tried to operate a school, but in the end, she turned to domestic 
          work to support herself. A job as a laundress to a family that spent 
          summers in the New England opened the way for Susie to move North. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In the mid-1870s, Susie King settled in Boston, 
          Massachusetts, where she met and married Russell L. Taylor, and where 
          she wrote and self-published <b><i>Reminiscences of My Life in Camp: 
          With the U.S. 33rd Colored United States Troops</i></b> (1902). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">34.<b> Clara Ann Thompson </b>(1869-1949) 
          was one of John Henry and Clara Jane Gray Thompson's three children 
          who had a passion for poetry. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, once enslaved in 
          Virginia, raised their children (five in all) in Rossmoyne, Ohio, not 
          far from Cincinnati. Except for a bit of teaching away from her hometown, 
          Clara Ann Thompson spent the entirety of her adult life in Rossmoyne, 
          living, along with her sister <b>Priscilla Jane Thompson</b>, with an 
          older brother, Garland Yancey Thompson. Clara's major avocation and 
          only vocation was writing poetry and holding readings. In 1908, several 
          years after Priscilla self-published her first collection of poems, 
          <b><i>Ethiope Lays</i></b> (1900) and brother Aaron self-published his 
          two volumes, <i>Morning Sun </i> (1899) and <i>Echoes of Spring </i>(1901), 
          Clara self-published her book of close to forty significantly religious 
          poems, <b><i>Songs from the Wayside</i></b>. In 1926, her second collection, 
          <b><i>A Garland of Poems</i></b>, was published by a company in Boston.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> <b>35. Priscilla Jane Thompson </b>(1871-1942), 
          like her older sister, <b>Clara Ann Thompson</b>, lived her entire life 
          in Rossmoyne, Ohio, and never married. Also like Clara, and their brother 
          Aaron, Priscilla Jane wrote poetry. She self-published two volumes of 
          verse. The first <b><i>Ethiope Lays</i></b> (1900) was an attempt she 
          said, "to picture the real side of my race . . . their patience, fortitude 
          and forbearance." Her second volume <b><i>Gleanings of Quiet Hours </i>
</b>(1907)<b> </b>contained many poems from the first.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">36. <b>Bethany Veney</b> (?-?), born 
          in slavery in Virginia, never knew her father and lost her mother when 
          she was about nine years old. The rest of her childhood was a river 
          of sadness, and as a young woman she lost the man she dearly loved and 
          with whom she had a child. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	In 1858, a Mr. G.J. Adams of Providence, Rhode 
          Island, purchased Veney for the sole purpose of freeing her, and she 
          began a fruitful life in the North. Known as "Aunt Betty," Veney was 
          in her seventies when she dictated her life story, probably to the M.W.G. 
          who wrote the preface to <b><i>The Narrative of Bethany Veney: A Slave 
          Woman</i></b> (1889). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">37. <b>Phillis Wheatley </b>(c. 1753-1784), 
          who is believed to have been a Fulani of Gambia, was named after the 
          slave schooner <i>Phillis</i> that hauled her to Boston Harbor in 1761. 
          At age seven or eight, she became the property of a local tailor, John 
          Wheatley, who later claimed that, "Without any assistance from School 
          Education, and by only what she was taught in the Family, she, in sixteen 
          Months Time from her arrival, attained the English Language, to which 
          she was an utter Stranger before, to such a Degree, as to read any, 
          the most difficult of Parts of the Sacred Writings." What's more, having 
          mastered English, Phillis Wheatley was keen to learn Latin.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	John Wheatley's statement on his servant's brilliance 
          is dated November 14, 1772. This statement was part of the front matter 
          to Phillis Wheatley's small collection of verse: <b><i>Poems on Various 
          Subjects, Religious and Moral</i></b> , which was published in England 
          in September 1773. With the book's publication, Phillis Wheatley became 
          the first African living in the British colonies to have a book published, 
          and the second American woman to have a book of verse published. Phillis 
          Wheatley became quite a sensation, especially in the Massachusetts Bay 
          Colony, and she was eventually freed, but the rest of her life was not 
          full of ease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 	In 1778, Phillis married John Peters and entered 
          a troubled existence. Early in their marriage the couple had two children, 
          both of whom were dead by 1784. At that point, Phillis Wheatley Peters, 
          around age thirty-one, was doing domestic work at a low rate boarding 
          house, and was pregnant again. The delivery was difficult; Phillis Wheatley 
          died in the process and her baby died a few hours later. All that was 
          left of this young genius's presence on this planet was her verse: her 
          famous book, and poems she had once hoped to include in a second book 
          of verse. </p>
